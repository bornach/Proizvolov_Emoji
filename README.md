# Proizvolov_Emoji
Self working card trick that uses the Proizvolov Identity to automatically identify which card the spectator has removed

See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAFr7HI2TxA for a demonstration of the card trick.

The design of these cards were inspired by a Numberphile video featuring Dr. James Grime presenting the Proizvolov Identity in the form of a card trick. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wv_qw3nQnI
